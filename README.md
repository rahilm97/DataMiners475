# DataMiners475
This repository contains source code for the Data Miners development team CSS 475 project. The team (Rahil Mehta, Tavi Tenari, Stan Huber, and Chayse Summers) is creating a database for automotive dealerships that will help with inventory and customer record management. This repository contains the source code for an access application for the database. The access application is a C# Windows Forms application. The AWS RDS instance used for the project has been taken down, so it will not function without a source of data.
